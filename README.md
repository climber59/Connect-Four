# Connect-Four
Two player Connect Four coded in MATLAB. I created this initially in 2016 to practice and experiment with GUI elements.

Click anywhere in the column you want to place your piece. Features a scoreboard, Undo button that can undo the entire game, colored turn indicator, and an option to decide who starts each game.

The function has two optional input arguments. The first 'scale' is the height of the initial window, in pixels, though you can drag to resize the window at any time. The second is the figure number the game will use if you want to specify for some reason.
